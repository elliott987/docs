Programming Your Robot
======================

<!-- Robots that are made using the SR kit are programmed with [Python](/docs/programming/python/) which is made possible with a custom-built Python library, `sr.robot3`; see [here](/docs/programming/robot_api/) for more details. The pages under this section should contain all of the information you need to know to successfully code for your robot.

* In order to develop the code for your robot, we recommend that you use a code
  editor. For more information about this, including some suggestions for
  suitable editors, see the [Code Editors](/docs/programming/editors/) section.

* Under the [Python](/docs/programming/python/) section, some of the more intricate features of Python are explained in sufficient detail to program a robot. Links to tutorials are also provided to introduce a new programmer to Python.

* Under the [sr](/docs/programming/sr/) section is an API reference for the Student Robotics module, used to interface with the hardware. -->


<!--
TODO - below is from python page

Student Robotics robots are all programmed in [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org);
to program a robot, it is important that you have a basic understanding of Python.

There are a number of tutorials out there which might help you to learn to program in Python:

* [Our tutorial](/docs/tutorials/python), called _Python: A whirlwind tour_.
    This was written especially for Student Robotics competitors,
    and explains the basics while trying not to overwhelm you.

* [The Official Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.10/tutorial/) -- the good stuff starts at chapter 3,
    but you should at least skim the stuff before it;
    there is a lot there and it may be a little overwhelming.

* A number of tutorials for beginners are linked to from [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers).
    [Wikibooks Tutorial](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer%27s_Tutorial_for_Python_3) seems like a good one.

* [The Official Docs](https://docs.python.org/3.10/), for the version of python on the [Brain Board](/docs/kit/brain_board). -->
