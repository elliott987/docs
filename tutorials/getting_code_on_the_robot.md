# Getting Code on the Robot

For your robot to function, it needs some code to tell it what to do.
This code will be written on your computer, but then needs to be transferred to your robot to execute it.

You will need to put your code on a USB drive which will need to be formatted with either FAT32, exFAT or ext2/3/4.
Upon plugging in the drive or starting up, the robot will run the `robot.py` file found in the root of the drive.

To re-run your program, remove the USB stick from the robot and plug it back in again and it will restart automatically.


## Windows

1. Open your code in File Explorer
2. Select all of your code files (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>A</kbd> to select all files)
3. Right-click the files and click "Copy" <span aria-hidden="true">(<i class="fa-regular fa-copy"></i> on Windows 11)</span>
4. Open your USB drive in File Explorer
5. Right-click in the directory and click "Paste"


## macOS

1. Open your code in Finder
2. Select all of your code files (<kbd>âŒ˜</kbd><kbd>A</kbd> to select all files)
3. Right-click (or Control-click) the files and click "Copy"
4. Open your USB drive in Finder
5. Right-click in the directory and click "Paste N items"


## Robot Logs

When your program runs on the robot, the output of `print(...)` statements and any errors which occur are written to a log file on the USB stick as `log.txt`.
These logs are also available to view live on the [web interface]({{ site.baseurl }}/kit/brain_board/web_interface).
