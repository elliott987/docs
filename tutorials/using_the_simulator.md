Using the simulator
===================

## Overview

Within the Webots IDE, there are a few different panels:

- In the centre of your screen is the 3D simulated view of the arena
- On the left is a tree hierarchy of all elements in this "world"
- At the bottom is the console, where output from your robot code will be displayed
- At the top are your general controls which include the time controls. Press the centre play button to run the simulation at normal speed.

### Useful links

- [Camera Controls](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-3d-window#navigation-in-the-scene)
- [Graphics settings](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/preferences#opengl) (Useful if Webots is running slowly)

## Time

In the simulated environment, time advances only at the pace that the simulator
is run. The relation between this time and the real passage of time depends on a
couple of factors: the speed the simulation is configured to run at and the
ability of the computer running the simulation to process it fast enough.

You can configure and observe the speed the simulator is running at from the toolbar in webots:

Here the simulation has run for 13.28 seconds, but is currently paused (the
speed multiplier shows 0.00×). You could choose to step a single time increment,
run the simulator at real speed (▶), or run the simulator at various faster
speeds (▶▶ and ▶▶▶).

These differences mean that your code will need to use a different mechanism to
find the current time or to sleep within the simulation. Find out more by
heading over to the [simulator programming docs](./programming).

## Programming

Once you have the simulator installed you can begin [programming your robot](./programming) in the simulator.
