# Pre-Kickstart Activities

The pre-Kickstart activities are a new concept we are introducing with SR2025. They use our simulator for a set of activities intended to be completed between registration and Kickstart. These will teach some core concepts of robotics and introduce some simple sensors that teams could use on their physical robots.

We recommend you work through them as a team, so you can learn from each other.
If you have any issues, just ask us on [Discord](/docs/tutorials/discord).

You can access the [the activities here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Kt72gt__4len23zyeAXD-qkSsHw72Il7PjfBgGqwnU/preview).
