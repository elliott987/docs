# Pre-Kickstart Activities

The pre-Kickstart activities provide a basic introduction to the kit which can be completed before Kickstart.

We recommend you work through them as a team, so you can learn from each other.
If you have any issues, just ask us on [Discord](/docs/tutorials/discord).

You can access the [the activities here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Kt72gt__4len23zyeAXD-qkSsHw72Il7PjfBgGqwnU/preview).
