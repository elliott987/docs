# Microgames

The microgames are way of getting familiar with your kit through a series of small challenges.


We recommend you work through them as a team, so you can learn from each other. If you have any issues, just ask us on [Discord](/docs/tutorials/discord).


You can access the [the SR2025 microgames here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xTCc62vyUaxdlzsaLpQiwkttAQEc6wc4csproAjo17E/preview).
