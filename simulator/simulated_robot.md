The Simulated Robot
===================

<img class="right" style="width: 320px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/content/simulator/sr2024-robot.png" alt="Image of the simulated robot">

There is a pre-built robot used in the simulator.
To allow this simulated robot to move around and sense its environment a set of motors and sensors have been connected as detailed below.

The simulatorâ€™s API is very similar to the real SR API described in the [programming docs]({{ site.baseurl }}/programming/).
The main differences are:

- the way that [time is handled]({{ site.baseurl }}/simulator/using_the_simulator#time),
- the simulated arduino only offering the plain SR Firmware interactions, and
- the simulated robot not having the Brain Board LEDs.

<div class="info">
  To more closely reflect reality, artificial noise has been added to simulated
  values such that sensors and actuators are not perfectly accurate, and may
  fluctuate slightly between measurements or operations.
</div>

## Motors

Your robot has one motor board attached, the motor on the left wheel is connected to the "Motor 0" port, and the right wheel to "Motor 1". These can be referenced with `robot.motor_board.motors[0]`, and `robot.motor_board.motors[1]`, respectively.
See [the motor board programming docs]({{ site.baseurl }}/programming/motors) for how to control these.

If you want to reference the motor board by its the part code, you can use the part code `srABC1`.

## Servos

Your robot has one servo board attached, the jaws of the robot and the lifter are all controlled by servos.

| Servo | Location  |
|-------|-----------|
| 0     | Left Jaw  |
| 1     | Right Jaw |
| 2     | Lifter    |

Setting each servo to -1 fully opens the respective jaw, setting them to 1 fully closes them.

Setting the lifter to -1 fully lowers the lifter, setting it to 1 fully raises it.

You can access the servos with `robot.servo_board.servos[N]` where N is the number of the servo from the table above. Read more at [the servo board programming docs]({{ site.baseurl }}/programming/servos).

If you want to reference the servo board by its the part code, you can use the part code `srXYZ2`.

## Arduino

Your robot has an arduino board, with one microswitch and six distance sensors, attached to the digital and analog pins respectively.

The simulated arduino behaves like one with the ordinary SR Firmware, the simulator doesn't support any [extended firmware]({{ site.baseurl }}/programming/arduino/extended_sr_firmware) or [custom arduino firmware]({{ site.baseurl }}/programming/arduino/custom_firmware). Read below for details on the individual sensors.

Make sure you have set the correct [pin_mode]({{ site.baseurl }}/programming/arduino/sr_firmware#setting-pin-modes), depending on what device you're using.

### Microswitches

The rear of the robot has a wide bump sensor attached to a microswitch.

The microswitch is attached to digital pin 2:

| Pin | Location | Required Mode |
|-----|----------|---------------|
| 2   | Back     | `INPUT`       |

This is shown as a red coloured block on the robot. You can access the servo using `robot.arduino.pins[2]`. Make sure you set the pin mode to `INPUT`. The `digital_read` method will return a `bool` telling you whether the switch is currently being pressed. You can read more in the [arduino programming docs page][arduino-programming].

### Distance Sensors

<!-- Changing this? Consider updating the "Simulated robot inputs" section in `simulator/using_the_simulator.md` -->

Analogous to [ultrasound sensors](https://robocraze.com/blogs/post/what-is-ultrasonic-sensor), distance sensors allow you to retrieve the distance between your robot and an object. These are attached to analog pins A0-A5:

| Pin | Location    | Required Mode |
|-----|-------------|---------------|
| A0  | Front Left  | `INPUT`       |
| A1  | Front Right | `INPUT`       |
| A2  | Left        | `INPUT`       |
| A3  | Right       | `INPUT`       |
| A4  | Front       | `INPUT`       |
| A5  | Back        | `INPUT`       |

These are shown as blue boards with silver transceivers on the robot. They can see in a narrow cone up to a maximum of about 2m away.
Since these sensors rely on echoes being reflected back from objects, if the angle of incidence between the sensor's pulse and the contacted surface exceeds 22.5 degrees then the sensor will be unable to detect the object.

You can access the ultrasound sensors using `robot.arduino.pins[AX]`, where '`AX`' is between `A0` and `A5`. Make sure you set the pin mode to `INPUT`. The `analog_read` method will return a voltage (0-5V) proportional to the distance. You can read more in the [arduino programming docs page][arduino-programming].

```python
reading = R.arduino.pins[A5].analog_read()
# convert reading from volts to meters
measurement = reading / 2.5
print(f"Rear ultrasound distance {measurement:.2f} meters")
```

### LEDs

Your robot has two LEDs mounted in clearly visible points on the robot. The LEDs are attached to digital pins 3-4:

| Pin | Location      | Required Mode |
|-----|---------------|---------------|
| 3   | Red (lower)   | `OUTPUT`      |
| 4   | Green (upper) | `OUTPUT`      |

You can access the LEDs using `robot.arduino.pins[3]` or `robot.arduino.pins[4]`. For the red or green LED, respectively. Make sure you set the pin mode to `OUTPUT`. You can read more in the [arduino programming docs page][arduino-programming].

Using the `digital_write` method, you can set these to `True` (On) or `False` (Off).

## Vision

<!-- Changing this? Consider updating the "Simulated robot inputs" section in `simulator/using_the_simulator.md` -->

The simulated robot has a camera which provides position and orientation
information about other objects within the simulation. This simulates the
system of fiducial markers which the physical robot's camera can detect.

You can access the camera with `robot.camera`. The simulated vision system matches the physical robot's vision API, so please use the [vision programming docs page]({{ site.baseurl }}/programming/vision/) as a reference. There are a few small differences between the simulator and the physical kit which are noted on that page.
